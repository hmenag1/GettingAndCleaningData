GettingAndCleaningData
======================

Course project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data taught by Jeff Leek

This project is composed of 2 R scripts "run_analysis.R" and "calcmeans.R". It will use the Samsung data set and will 
combine the train and test files to create one data set. It will then identify each variable by adding the name of 
the activities and by naming each variable. Next it will extract the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
The activities were given more descriptive names and each measurement was given a more descriptive name.
Finally a second tidy data set was created.
